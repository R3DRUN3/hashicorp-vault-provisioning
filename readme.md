## Abstract
[HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) is a secrets management tool specifically designed to control access to sensitive credentials in a low-trust environment. 
<br>
It can be used to store sensitive values and, at the same time, dynamically generate access for specific services/applications on lease.

This repo contains scripts to provision your own on-prem Vault test instance via Vagrant and Ansible

## Requirements
`vagrant` `ansible`
